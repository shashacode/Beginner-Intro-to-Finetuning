**Fine-Tuning an African Language Model: A Beginner’s Guide for Aspiring AI Researchers**

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide for aspiring AI researchers in Africa and beyond who want to fine-tune AI models on low-resource languages. The tutorial walks you through the full pipeline of fine-tuning a machine translation model from English to Yoruba using a pre-trained model (castorini/afriteva_base), demonstrating how local data can be used to make AI more inclusive and context-aware.

**Why This Project Matters**

Most large language models (LLMs) are trained on high-resource languages like English, Mandarin, or French. This results in poor performance for African languages like Yoruba, Igbo, Swahili, and Pidgin. Our communities risk being left behind if our languages aren't represented in AI.

This project empowers you to:

- Understand the concept of fine-tuning.

- Prepare and preprocess your local dataset.

- Train, evaluate, and deploy your own AI model tailored to your language.

**What You’ll Learn**

- Basics of fine-tuning a Seq2Seq (translation) model

- How to work with Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets

- Preprocessing low-resource text data for model training

- Evaluating model performance with BLEU scores

- Saving and running inference on your fine-tuned model

**Tools & Technologies required**

- Transformers

- Datasets

- Evaluate (BLEU, CHRF, TER)

- Hugging Face Hub

- Google Colab

- Weights & Biases (optional)

**Dataset**

**Source:** [Kaggle – English-Yoruba Translation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danishbaloch010/parallel-yoruba-english-prompts-for-translation?resource=download)

Each row consists of:

en: English sentence

yor: Corresponding Yoruba translation

You can adapt this notebook to any other parallel dataset in CSV, TSV, or JSON format.

**Note**: Colab's GPU might be insufficient for large-scale finetuning; consider using Weights & Biases Sweep + API for extended training.

**Credits & Community**

This guide was created to support young African researchers in contributing to inclusive AI. Inspired by the works of the Masakhane community, and built with the support of open-source AI tools.
